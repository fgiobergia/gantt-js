## TODO
1. Fix "hard" selectors in CSS (move to class-based naming, so as not to affect other elements in the target page)
2. Export customization constants to a separate file (for ease of manipulation) and add documentation
3. Improve "mobile" version (currently, the image is not shown and is replaced by a list of entries -- not too appealing)
4. Refactor some code: the "setAttribute" parts are the same everywhere -- use a function ffs!
